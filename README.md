The project aims to develop a quantitative analysis model for the stock market using Rust. This model will analyze historical stock data to identify trends, predict future price movements, and generate trading signals. The project's motivation is to leverage Rust's performance capabilities to process large datasets efficiently and to provide real-time analysis for informed trading decisions.

Goals and Objectives
To develop a high-performance quantitative analysis tool capable of processing large volumes of stock market data.
To implement algorithms for trend analysis, prediction, and signal generation.

Major Components
Data Ingestion: Mechanism to fetch historical and real-time stock market data from various sources (APIs such as Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance).
Data Storage: Efficient storage solution for ingested data, possibly utilizing Rust's database libraries (e.g., diesel for SQL databases)
Core algorithms for data analysis, including statistical analysis, trend identification, and predictive modeling
Signal Generator: Logic to translate analysis results into actionable trading signals (buy, sell, hold) based on predefined criteria or thresholds.

Roadmap and Checkpoints
Checkpoint 1: Setup project structure and dependencies. Establish data ingestion mechanisms for fetching stock data.
Checkpoint 2: Implement data storage solutions and ensure efficient management of historical data.
Checkpoint 3: Develop the initial version of the analysis engine capable of basic statistical analysis.
Checkpoint 5: Implement the signal generator and integrate it with the analysis model.

Possible Challenges
Data Volume and Performance: Efficiently handling and processing large volumes of stock market data in real-time will require careful attention to performance optimization.
API Limitations: Dependence on external APIs for data could introduce limitations, such as rate limits or changes in API structure.
Accuracy and Reliability: Ensuring the model's predictions and signals are accurate and reliable enough for real-world
